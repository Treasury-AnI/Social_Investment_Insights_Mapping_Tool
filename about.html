<h2>Children and youth at higher risk of poor outcomes</h2>

<p>This work is part of the Treasury's commitment to higher living standards and to an inclusive society where all New Zealanders 
can participate. The tool provides information about New Zealand children (aged 0 to 14) and youth (aged 15 to 24) 
at higher risk of poor future outcomes. </p>

<p> Analytical papers describing the underlying analysis in detail are also available.  See: </p>

<li> <a href="http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/ap/2016/16-01">Characteristics of Children at Greater Risk of Poor Outcomes as Adults </a>  (AP 16/01) (February 2016)</li>

</ul>

<p> Statistics New Zealand and the Treasury developed this tool in order to make complex data more easily accessible and available for New Zealanders.  The analysis and online tool have been made possible through Statistics New Zealand's Integrated Data Service. Through the collection of data from across the public sector (such as health, education and justice), Statistics New Zealand are enabling the analysis and understanding needed to improve social and economic outcomes for New Zealanders. </p>

<h3>What does the tool do?</h3>

<p>The Social Investment Insights tool tells us about children and youth living in different areas of New Zealand, and can be used to help inform timelier and better targeted services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maps can be generated for the whole of New Zealand or for specific regions and territorial authorities. Within Auckland, specific local board areas can be selected.</li>
<li>Data can be presented at a broad region level, at territorial authority level (local board in the case of Auckland), or at a level as detailed as area unit (the equivalent of a city suburb).</li>
<li>Specific age groups can be presented and risk groups specific to that age group mapped.</li>
<li> Data can be presented for males and females separately, or for all children or all youth in the age group.</li>
<li> Maps are presented alongside other information that describes the children and young people at higher risk of poor outcomes in that area, what this means in terms of their future outcomes, and some of the associated costs to government.</li>
<li>Map data can be downloaded for later use.</li>
</ul>

<p> In some cases region, territorial authority, and area unit boundaries overlap. In cases where only parts of an area lie within a selected region or territorial authority, the data presented only relates to these parts of the area and not to the whole area. </p>

<h3>About the data used</h3>

<p>The study uses the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI), which was developed and is 
maintained by Statistics New Zealand. The data is held in a secure environment, and 
made available to researchers under strict conditions. The IDI includes a wide range of 
survey and administrative data from across government agencies. The analysis was undertaken 
by the Treasury, working with other agencies.</p>

<h3>What does the analysis show us?</h3>

<p>This analysis tells us about children aged 14 and under, and youth aged 15 to 24, 
who are at higher risk of poor outcomes later in life. It identifies indicators 
that are associated with higher risk of poor future outcomes, shows the likelihood of 
these outcomes occurring, and identifies some of the costs associated with these outcomes.</p>

<h3>Children at risk: Four key risk indicators</h3>

<p>Using the information already collected by government agencies we can identify four indicators 
that are associated with having poor outcomes later in life. These are:</p>

<ol>
<li>    Having a CYF finding of abuse or neglect (8% of children) </li>
<li>    Being mostly supported by benefits since birth (15% of children) </li>
<li>    Having a parent with a prison or community sentence (17% of children) </li>
<li>    Having a mother with no formal qualifications (10% of children) </li>
</ol>

<p>Children who have these indicators are more likely to leave school with no qualifications, to spend time on benefit, and to receive a prison or community sentence. The greater the number of indicators a child has, the more likely this will happen. </p>

<p>Children aged 0 to 5 and aged 6 to 14 are represented separately, according to whether they have two or more risk indicators, three or more risk indicators, or all four risk indicators.</p>

<h3>Youth at risk: Ten target populations</h3>

<p>As children get older the information we have about them gets richer and more complex. As such, it's not 
possible to pick a few risk indicators that predict poor outcomes as we did for children. A richer picture 
helps us to make predictions, but also adds complexity. For this reason we developed a more sophisticated 
way to identify those youth most at risk of poor outcomes. We identified ten groups, or target 
populations - five at ages 15 to 19, and five at ages 20 to 24.</p>

<p><b> 15 to 19 year olds </b></p>

<ul>
<li>Teenage boys with Youth Justice or Corrections history</li>
<li>Teenagers with health, disability issues or special needs</li>
<li>Teenage girls supported by benefits</li>
<li>Mental health service users with stand-down or CYF history</li>
<li>Experienced significant childhood disadvantage</li>
</ul>

<p><b> 20 to 24 year olds </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Young offenders with custodial sentence</li>
<li>Young offenders with community sentence and CYF history</li>
<li>Jobseekers in poor health with CYF history</li>
<li>Sole parents not in fulltime employment with CYF history</li>
<li>Long-term disability beneficiaries</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the tool</h3>

<p>A number of 'pull-down menus' can be used to change the map, focussing in on particular areas or risk groups. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gender: Male, Female, Total</li>
<li>Age Group: 00-05, 06-14, 15-19, 20-24</li>
<li>Risk Measure: Changes with the age group selected, as above.</li>
<li>View Type: Allows you to choose to map the whole of New Zealand or to focus on a particular region or territorial authority. Within Auckland selecting ‘Territorial Authority’ allows you to then select a specific Local Board area.</li>
<li>Selected Region/Territorial Authority (if Region or Territorial Authority View Type selected).</li>
<li>Geographic Detail Displayed: Allows you to modify the level of geographical detail displayed. If you have selected a specific Region or Territorial Authority, this goes down to Area Unit (city suburb) level.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Caveats</h3>

<p> The data has a number of limitations and caveats: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The scope of the data is limited by the nature and breadth of the information collected in agencies’ administrative systems and included in the IDI. For example, the administrative data provides only a partial picture of childhood adversity, service use and service costs.</li>
  <li>The population coverage errors, linkage errors and biases present mean that the results are indicative only, and not highly accurate estimates.</li>
  <li>The methods used to estimate future outcomes and costs are designed to provide a comparative picture of future outcomes and costs for different population subgroups, but they have some significant limitations. These estimates should be viewed as indicative, and not as forecasts of the actual outcomes and costs that will be incurred in the future.</li>
  <li>Geographical location is derived from administrative information held by government agencies. In some cases this data may be inaccurate or out of date, and individuals may be allocated to areas in which they don’t reside as a result.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the results highlight the power of using integrated administrative data in new and innovative ways, some of the methods are exploratory in nature, and as such the results should be considered as preliminary, requiring further testing and development over time. </p>
